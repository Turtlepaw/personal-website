## Setup
#### Deploying with Vercel
If you're using Vercel to host, use this button.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTurtlepaw%2Fpersonal-website)

#### Setup Guide
After that, or if you're not using vercel:

1. Go ahead and use the `Use Template` button, skip this step if you've used [the button above](#deploying-with-vercel).
![Use Template Button](/media/8ycaM4PXCM.png)
2. Start off by cloning your repo (`git clone [URL]`)
3. Once you're done that, run `yarn` to install all the required packages
4. Make sure there's no errors by running `yarn dev`
5. Now, you can start configuring your site by going to `_app.tsx` and editing the `Configuration` object

6. You're almost done, deploy your site with your favorite hosting tool, you can even use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
7. **üéâ You're done!** If you like this template, please give it a **‚≠ê Star**

## Advanced Configuration
If you're looking to change some of these [Configurable Text/Items](#configurable-textitems), you can edit these by going to `_app.tsx` and changing the `Configuration` object:

```ts
export const Configuration: WebsiteConfiguration = {
  Name: "Username",
  Avatar: "/Avatar.svg",
  DiscordTag: "#0000",
  Description: "Hello, I'm an open-source personal website template!"
}
```
***Pro Tip:** Hover on a property (e.g. `Name`) to get more information on it.*

If you want to edit more than that, just edit the React code!

## Adding Redirection Links
Start by going into `next.config.js`, you can create a redirection link like this:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  //...
  async redirects() {
    return [
      ...MultipleLinks("https://discord.com/", "/r"),
      // You can put more links here by copying the
      // code above.
    ]
  }
}
```

## Notes
#### Icons
If you're looking to get more of the icons provided, they are from Fluent Icons by Microsoft, I'm using [this website](https://fluenticons.co) to find and download them.

#### Skill Icons
Skill icons (shown in `My Skills` or in `/public/icons`) were put together by [Skill Icons](https://skillicons.dev/). Check out their [license](https://github.com/Turtlepaw/personal-website/blob/main/SkillIcons_LICENSE) or their [Github](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons)
